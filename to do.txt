To do:

1.) Finish identifying and tagging all conjunctions, adjectives, adverbs, interjections, articles, etc. with their own colours

2.) Translate text, host as .txt file.

3.) Create hover-over links that will reveal translations / grammatical info for all words and clauses.

4.) Include full translation as a link on a separate xml page using Roman font.



Long term goals:

1.) Create an index page that links to both main text and translation

2.) Perhaps display text and translation side-by-side

3.) Perhaps make it so one can "turn" the page to see translation / original text

4.) completely mark-up (and clean) all tags pertaining to grammar, suffixes, prefixes, infixes, vowel mutation, etc.
